# GuildedChatExporter

Exports your dearest chats from Guilded to html files, along with downloading all attachments from said channels.

## [Click here to run the Chat Exporter through Google Colab.](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Fatih120/GuildedChatExporter/blob/main/guildedchatexporter.ipynb)
### ⚠️This tool is in another WIP due to the announcement of Guilded getting killed, my lack of attention, and changes to Guilded's backend. Please, contact me to fix any bugs so we can save your stuff before then. Actually-smart coders are very welcome.
Everything below is "old".

<hr>

Currently exports all text/voice/stream channels with 70% accuracy, DMs, emoji, media of all sorts, and a bunch of raw JSONs for preservation and future data entry.

Currently being done in google colab and is unfortunately made with AI, standalone/desktop versions probably won't happen with the time constraints since I've poured so much sweat and blood trying to get this together and it is a mess. After Roblox logins take effect I will no long er be interested in Guilded.

# How to use

Just follow the instructions in the Colab. To do each step, click on the play button on the top left. Go in order and check instructions (the first cell asks you to pick a server). I'm not sure if you can copy this over to a non-google service, I'm sorry FOSS lovers. At the very least, I have tested this on Colab successfully and you can probably get this working locally.
