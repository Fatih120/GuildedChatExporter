# GuildedChatExporter

## 🪦 Guilded is Guildead.

Guilded.gg has shut down, rendering this notebook effectively useless aside from those with JSON backups. Even then, if there are changes to HTML generation or new changes, they will likely appear in a new repository that exclusively focuses on exported JSONs.

I appreciate those pointing out errors and bugs to squash so that I could hopefully aid those looking to archive their precious memories. Thank you.

Exports your dearest chats from Guilded to html files, along with downloading all attachments from said channels.

## [Click here to run the Chat Exporter through Google Colab.](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Fatih120/GuildedChatExporter/blob/main/guildedchatexporter.ipynb)

⚠️This tool is complete enough to get the raw data of your servers and DMs for safekeeping, along with media, but it doesn't export all channel types to HTML yet. This will probebly be done *after* Guilded dies, so you should use this tool anyway before you can't anymore as this raw data can be processed post-mortem.
Everything below is "old".

Currently exports all text/voice/stream channels with 70% accuracy, DMs, emoji, media of all sorts, and a bunch of raw JSONs for preservation and future data entry.

Currently being done in google colab and is unfortunately made with AI, standalone/desktop versions probably won't happen with the time constraints since I've poured so much sweat and blood trying to get this together and it is a mess. After Roblox logins take effect I will no longer be interested in Guilded.

There is a way to [run this locally without using Google](https://jupyter.org/install), which may help if you have HUGE servers to download or hate Google. This repo won't cover how to do that.

# How to use

Just follow the instructions in the Colab. To do each step, click on the play button on the top left. Go in order and check instructions (the first cell asks you to pick a server).
